# TicTacToe

Simple Tic-Tac-Toe console game, written in C# with Visual Studio 2015.
You can play against AI that implements MinMax algorithm.

This game, only purpose, was to help me to understand and apply MinMax algorithm.

I found Patrick Winston [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=STjW3eH0Cik), from Open MIT Academy, extremely useful.
